        <b>What is MixedUp?</b>\n\n
It\'s a <b>companion app</b> for you&#8212;if you use a kitchen scale to weigh the food you eat,
and then track calories and nutrient info in a food diary.\n\n

<b>What MixedUp does for you:</b>\n\n
It calculates calorie and nutrient information
of foods that you weigh on a food scale.\n\n


It does <u>not</u> track your food intake.  \n\n

But it <u>does</u> give you data for your food diary.\n\n


<b>What\'s unique about MixedUp?</b>\n\n
The heart of this app is getting nutrient info
about "mixed up" foods such as homemade smoothies or casseroles.\n\n
You can weigh a portion of mixed up food, and get some
data for your food diary.\n\n


<b>But nutrient info for portions of mixed up foods can\'t be exact, can it?</b>\n\n
No, if you scoop only cheesy noodles out of your casserole and none of the chicken,
then the nutrient info will not adequately represent what\'s on your plate.\n\n
However, if your scoop of the casserole is reasonably well-balanced, then your nutrient info
will be <b>close enough</b> to be useful for your food diary.\n\n
